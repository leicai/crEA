# crEA
This program mainly implements the crEA algorithm which was described in our paper:
Lei Cai, Shiru Qua,Yuan Yuan,and Xin Yao. A clustering-ranking method for many-objective optimization.
Applied Soft Computing 35 (2015):681â€“694.

It proposes a new approach: clustering-ranking evolutionary algorithm, where the two procedures (clustering and ranking) are 
implemented sequentially.
---
The code was written in Java and based on the jMetal framework.

The algorithmic procedures of crEA can be seen in the files :crEA.java. We also illustrated how to run this algorithm on a specific problem in the crEA_main.java respectively.

Note that, this code can be used only for non-commercial purposes. We'd appreciate your acknowledgement if you use the code. 

For any problem concerning the code, please feel free to contact Dr. Cai (caileid@gmail.com).
